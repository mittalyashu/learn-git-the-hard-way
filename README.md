# Learn Git The Hard Way

This file file serves as your book's preface, a great place to describe your book's content and ideas.

Welcome to the world of Git. I hope this book will help to advance your understanding of this powerful content tracking system, and reveal a bit of the simplicity underlying it — however dizzying its array of options may seem from the outside.

Before we dive in, there are a few terms which should be mentioned first, since they’ll appear repeatedly throughout this text:

| Keyword | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| repository | A repository is a collection of commits, each of which is an archive of what the project's working tree looked like at a past date, whether on your machine or someone else's. It also defines _HEAD_, which identifies the branch or commit the current working tree stemmed from. Lastly, it contains a set of _branches_ and _tags_, to identify certain commits by name. |
| HEAD | **HEAD** is used by your repository to define what is currently checked out: • If you checkout a branch, HEAD symbolically refers to that branch, indicating that the branch name should be updated after the next commit operation. • If you checkout a specific commit, HEAD refers to that commit only. This is referred to as a _detached HEAD_, and occurs, for example, if you check out a tag name. |
